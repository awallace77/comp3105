#### Prereq

Make sure you have python 3.11 installed.

1. Navigate to `comp3105/a1` in your terminal
2. Run `python3.11 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate by running the command `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. If using vscode open the a1 directory
   Then `ctrl + shift + p` > "Python select interpreter"
   Select Python 3.11.x from the .venv folder (if not already selected)

### Workflow

To start working please create a branch off of `main` by using the command `git checkout -b <your branch name>`.

Once you complete a task / question, save all your files add run the following to commit and push to the repo:
`git add .` where "." is the current folder (you can also specify the path to specific files)
`git commit -m "<A short description about the changes here>"`
`git push -u origin <your branch name>`

Your changes will now be pushed to the remote repository where we can merge into the main branch via a Pull request.
